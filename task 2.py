def bubble_sort_optimized(arr):
    """
    Optimized Bubble Sort Algorithm
    This implementation of bubble sort has a best-case time complexity of Î¸(n)
    when the input array is already sorted. The optimization is achieved by
    introducing a 'swapped' flag that checks if any elements were swapped
    during each pass through the array. If no elements are swapped, the array
    is already sorted, and we can break out of the loop early.

        swapped = False  # Flag to detect any swap operation
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:  # Compare adjacent elements
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]  # Swap if needed
                swapped = True  # A swap occurred
        if not swapped:  # If no swaps occurred, the array is sorted
            break
